It turned out really cool and even earned us a spot on Airbnb's Instagram (you can find the link to our other properties below) but left us feeling like we needed a vacation in one of those peaceful bohemian little islands you see in postcards. From that feeling we took our inspiration and made this place. Although very close to everything (I will include proximity maps and distances below) when I am inside I am at peace and heres how we did it. For the location we chose a locals only neighborhood where the diversity of Los Angeles can clearly be seen and felt. There is a little mexican and south american market a minute walk away. If you walk the other direction Korea and Thai town another minute walk away. Sometimes I want to remember my travels to Turkey and just walk 5 minutes down where I can find authentic turkish and armenian food in the \"Llittle Armenia\" area. I love this part of LA, having little bits of the world for you to enjoy is so important. Of course there is also all the unique Los Angeles attractions, like the  famous Hollywood sign which you can see from the window, the Hollywood Cemetery where you can famous grave hunt or sit down and watch an open air movie in the summer. The Walk of Stars, comedy clubs, theaters, Hollywood and Vine, the Chinese Theater etc etc etc are all less then 2 miles away.   "], ["For the apartment itself, we took bits and pieces from all the areas I mentioned above and made them work together much like our neighborhood. We got the peace and decompression we sought by choosing bold yet melodious colors that alleviated us of the LA beat but kept us close to its essence, much like our location. A low to the ground bed made from pallets we found close by, were sanded, painted and used for an organic feel. Anytime you see a hanging hammock the feeling of relaxation comes to mind so in search of this relaxing bohemian get away we hung our own hammock from the ceiling where you can read or nap or maybe just swing like a kid while you stare at the Hollywood sign outside the window. We used discarded crates from a local Thai market to make coffee and side tables. An old discarded vanity from west Hollywood was transformed into a desk with character that will hopefully help write a romantic letter or two. We gave an old rattan love seat from a failed actor a new life. A wicker basket from a young man giving all his possessions away just for the sake of good karma sits in the living room doing exactly what his prior owner had hoped for. The paint cans that were used on our walls now give life to succulent plants picked from West Hollywood sidewalks.
